# TimeSeriesAnalysis-Visualization
This Python code focuses on time series forecasting and data visualization. It loads time series data from an Excel file, preprocesses it, visualizes the data, and then performs time series forecasting using two different methods: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Exponential Smoothing.
